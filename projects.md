# Lab Research

- TS-RAG X: Historical Context-Enhanced Retrieved Augmentation Generation for Time Series Foundation Models. *In Progress* <br>

  **Description:** This project expands the capacity of [TS-RAG][https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07649], a retrieval-augmented generation framework for enhancing the generalization and interpretability of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), by introducing the retrieved historical contexts in the augmentation module. TS-RAG X enables retrieval of semantically relevant segments from a dedicated knowledge base through incorporating both context windows and their associated future horizons.

  I am fortunate to conduct this project under the guidance of [Professor Dongjin Song][https://songdj.github.io] funded through an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) supplement.
