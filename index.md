# Hello, I’m Ulad! 
---

I am a fourth-year student at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu), where I am pursuing a BA in Applied Mathematics with a Computer Science minor and a BA in Statistics with an Economics minor. 

Beyond my classic academic journey, I am actively researching novel Machine Learning methods for temporal data. The central theme of my research is to develop novel ML algorithms for modeling temporal dynamics in data. In particular, I am interested in developing novel ML methods and frameworks for modeling temporal data exhibiting long-range dependence, or long-memory. Traditionally, fractionally-integrated time series models (ex. ARFIMA, ARTFIMA, etc.) are widely used in modeling applications for data exhibiting long-memory across the data entrees. On the other hand, many ML methods often struggle to capture such complex temporal dynamics, posing new statistical and computational challenges, and I aim to develop novel learning methods with capacities for handling "long-memoryness" along with statistical theory to address this fundamental limitation.
