# About

I am a fourth-year student at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu), where I am pursuing dual B.A. degrees in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science and Statistics with a minor in Economics. Here is my <a href="/folder1/UC_CV_grad_schools.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a>.

Beyond my classic academic journey, I am actively researching novel **Machine Learning methods for temporal data**. The central theme of my research is to develop novel ML methods and frameworks for modeling temporal data exhibiting long-range dependence, or long memory. Traditionally, fractionally-integrated time series models (ex. ARFIMA, FIGARCH, etc.) are widely used in modeling applications for data exhibiting long-memory across the data entrees. On the other hand, many ML methods often struggle to capture such complex temporal dynamics, posing new statistical and computational challenges. I aim to develop novel learning methods capable of modeling long memory patterns across observations in data, along with the supporting statistical theory to address this fundamental limitation.
