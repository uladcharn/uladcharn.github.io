Undergraduate student at the University of Connecticut with a research background in Reinforcement Learning theory and Time Series. My current research involves developing novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms on the basis of Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LinUCB) RL framework for operating with Time Series data exhibiting long-memory persistence.
